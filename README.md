# Ky8er-Bot

First Bot to to help practice programming

Please be gentle

## Prefix: ^

## Current "Commands"

Getting better and adding more "advanced" commands

    - When the user types "^help" it will display a list of commands that, eventually, only normal users can use

    - When the user types "^modhelp" it will display a list of commands that, eventually, only mods can use

    - When the user types "^hello" it will respond with **[REDACTED]**

    - When the user types "^ping", it will display that the bot is online with an "Average heartbeat ping of the websocket"

    - When the user types "^server", it will display the name of the server

    - When the user types "^numbers" it will display the number of users in the server

    - When the user types "^join" the bot will join the voice channel they are in

    - When the user types "^dc" the bot will leave, even when the user isn't in a voice channel [Will Fix]

## Plans

    - Play Music from YouTube/other Music Sources

    - Have only 1 help command that checks to see what permissions the user has and then displays the correct one
