# Ky8er-Bot

First Bot to to help practice programming

Please be gentle

## Prefix: ^

## Current "Commands"

Getting better and adding more "advanced" commands

    - ^help -  bot will display a list of commands that, eventually, only normal users can use

    - ^modhelp - bot will display a list of commands that, eventually, only mods can use

    - ^hello - bot will respond with **[REDACTED]**

    - ^ping - bot will display that the bot is online with an "Average heartbeat ping of the websocket"

    - ^server - bot will display the name of the server

    - ^numbers - bot will display the number of users in the server

    - ^join - bot will join the voice channel they are in

    - ^dc - bot will leave, even when the user isn't in a voice channel [Will Fix]

    - ^play + YouTube URL - bot will play given URL [ONLY 1 SONG AT A TIME]

## Plans

    - Play Music from YouTube/other Music Sources
        - Done, just need to allow a Queue and Media Options

    - Have only 1 help command that checks to see what permissions the user has and then displays the correct one
